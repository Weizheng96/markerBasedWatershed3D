# markerBasedWatershed3D


The "watershed3D.h" is the only thing you need.

The "main.cpp" is just an example of how to use "watershed3D.h".


This is a header file of 3D marker-based watershed. Should be very fast. Only STL is used in the code. No dependency needed.

For my own purpuse, the watershed pixels will be randomly assigned to one marker, which is different frrom original difinition.

I referred the 2D traditional watershed code from, but this original code may contain bugs : https://ofstack.com/C++/22898/c++-watershed-algorithm-(watershed-algorithm).html
