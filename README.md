# markerBasedWatershed3D

This is a header file of 3D marker-based watershed. Should be very fast.
For my own purpuse, the watershed pixels will be randomly assigned to one marker, which is different frrom original difinition.
I referred the 2D traditional watershed code from, but this original code may contain bugs : https://ofstack.com/C++/22898/c++-watershed-algorithm-(watershed-algorithm).html
