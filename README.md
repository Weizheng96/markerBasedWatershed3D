# markerBasedWatershed3D

This is a header file of 3D marker-based watershed.
The "watershed3D.h" is the only thing you need.
The "main.cpp" is just an example of how to use "watershed3D.h".


It should be very fast. 

No dependency needed.

I referred the 2D traditional watershed code from https://ofstack.com/C++/22898/c++-watershed-algorithm-(watershed-algorithm).html, but this original code may contain bugs.
